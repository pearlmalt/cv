      here is another paragraph that adds more context to this website concept.
      today Emily and i got BBQ at a place called Just Potato Salad. it was out
      of this world tasty. looking forward to eating JPS again. big hint, there
      was much much much more than potato salad.

    <h3>Some schools I've attended:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>CalTech</strong> This was regretable for several reasons, mainly
        that it wasn't a good fit for me personally on this current coding
        journey.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>SheCodes</strong> It struck me as odd that this school for woman
        was taught only by a man.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Udemy</strong> wish i had foun this in the beginning, but what
        are u gunna do.
      </li>
      <li><strong>youtubes</strong> a lot of videos later.</li>
    </ul>
